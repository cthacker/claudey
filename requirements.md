# Claudey: Claude Code Agent System - Requirements Documentation

## Overview

This specification defines the requirements for "Claudey," a structured development workflow system that uses specialized Claude Code agents to implement a systematic, test-driven approach to software development. The system provides four specialized agents (planner, architecture, tasker, coder) that work in sequence to transform high-level ideas into implemented features through a structured 4-phase development process.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Agent Management System

**FR-001.1** The system shall provide four distinct specialized agents with unique roles and capabilities.

**FR-001.2** When a user invokes an agent by name, the system shall activate the corresponding agent configuration file with its specific role-based instructions.

**FR-001.3** The system shall ensure each agent has access to standardized Claude Code tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.) while maintaining role-specific behavioral constraints.

### FR-002: Planning Agent (Planner)

**FR-002.1** The planner agent shall transform high-level feature concepts into structured requirements documentation using EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) format.

**FR-002.2** When provided with conceptual ideas or designs, the planner agent shall decompose them into specific, measurable behaviors and capabilities.

**FR-002.3** The planner agent shall generate requirements documents containing:
- Overview section with feature summary
- Functional requirements using EARS patterns
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Technical and business constraints
- Assumptions and dependencies
- Measurable acceptance criteria

**FR-002.4** The planner agent shall ensure each requirement follows one of five EARS patterns:
- Ubiquitous: "The [system/component] shall [system response]"
- Event-driven: "When [trigger condition], the [system/component] shall [system response]"
- Unwanted behavior: "If [unwanted condition], then the [system/component] shall [system response]"
- State-driven: "While [system state], the [system/component] shall [system response]"
- Optional: "Where [feature is included], the [system/component] shall [system response]"

### FR-003: Architecture Agent (Arch)

**FR-003.1** The architecture agent shall create comprehensive technical design documentation based on requirements specifications.

**FR-003.2** When provided with requirements documentation, the architecture agent shall design system components, integration points, and technical architecture.

**FR-003.3** The architecture agent shall establish coding standards, development practices, and architectural patterns for the project.

**FR-003.4** The architecture agent shall generate architecture.md files containing detailed technical specifications ready for task breakdown.

### FR-004: Task Management Agent (Tasker)

**FR-004.1** The tasker agent shall convert requirements and design documentation into atomic, executable coding tasks.

**FR-004.2** When provided with completed requirements and architecture documentation, the tasker agent shall create a tasks.md file containing structured implementation tasks.

**FR-004.3** The tasker agent shall organize tasks into three phases:
- Phase 1: Sequential tasks (must be completed in order)
- Phase 2: Independent tasks (can be completed in parallel)
- Phase 3: Integration tasks (require completion of prerequisite tasks)

**FR-004.4** The tasker agent shall ensure each task includes:
- Clear implementation details and approach
- Files to modify or create
- Explicit dependency relationships
- Testable acceptance criteria
- Time estimates (1-4 hours per task)

### FR-005: Implementation Agent (Coder)

**FR-005.1** The coder agent shall execute individual tasks from the task list systematically and with high quality standards.

**FR-005.2** When assigned a specific task, the coder agent shall load and analyze tasks.md, CLAUDE.md, and architecture.md files for context.

**FR-005.3** The coder agent shall implement code that follows existing patterns, includes comprehensive error handling, and has appropriate unit tests.

**FR-005.4** The coder agent shall verify implementation meets acceptance criteria before marking tasks complete.

**FR-005.5** The coder agent shall maintain an execution-log.md file documenting completed tasks, file modifications, and implementation notes.

**FR-005.6** The coder agent shall execute only one task at a time and wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to subsequent tasks.

### FR-006: Installation and Setup System

**FR-006.1** The system shall provide an automated installation script (install.sh) that sets up all agent configurations.

**FR-006.2** When executed, the installation script shall create ~/.claude/agents/ directory if it does not exist.

**FR-006.3** The installation script shall install agent configuration files as symlinks to maintain synchronization with repository updates.

**FR-006.4** The installation script shall automatically backup existing agent files before installation.

**FR-006.5** The installation script shall provide detailed installation feedback and completion status.

### FR-007: Workflow Integration

**FR-007.1** The system shall support a sequential 4-phase development workflow: Planning → Architecture → Task Breakdown → Implementation.

**FR-007.2** When transitioning between phases, the system shall ensure required documentation from previous phases is available and complete.

**FR-007.3** The system shall maintain project-specific development standards in CLAUDE.md files that all agents can reference.

**FR-007.4** The system shall support iterative refinement within each phase before proceeding to the next phase.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-001: Performance Requirements

**NFR-001.1** The system shall minimize Claude Code context usage by maintaining specialized agents with focused responsibilities.

**NFR-001.2** Agent configuration files shall load within 2 seconds when invoked through Claude Code.

**NFR-003.2** Each agent shall provide clear, structured output that guides users to the next appropriate action.

**NFR-003.3** The installation process shall require no technical configuration from users beyond running a single command.
